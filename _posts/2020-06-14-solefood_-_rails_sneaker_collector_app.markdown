### My rails app was designed for a sneaker collector to add his/her sneaker, create a brand or choose an existing brand from a drop down menu and build a catalog of sneakers. User can edit delete & update sneakers. Users can see all brands, all sneakers within the app and also comment on other sneaker posts within the network.


### The Rails project explores the conventions of MVC, Validations, Authorization, CRUD & Restful Routes.
