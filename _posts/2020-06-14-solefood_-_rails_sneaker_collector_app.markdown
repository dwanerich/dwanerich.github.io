### My rails app was designed for a sneaker collector to add his/her sneaker, create a brand or choose an existing brand from a drop down menu and build a catalog of sneakers. User can edit delete & update sneakers. Users can see all brands, all sneakers within the app and also comment on other sneaker posts within the network.
