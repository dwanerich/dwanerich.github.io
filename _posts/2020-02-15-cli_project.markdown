Today i have just completed the first CLI Project which has been an incredible experience as this has been the first time we took a blank canvas and actually created something from scratch opposed to labs & testing.

In this CLI Project initially was going to scrape from a TimeOut magazine some NYC landmarks, their locations in the city with brief description. Ultimately i went with an API a more steady dependable resource.

My CLI project consists of calling on a New York Times API accesses top news from all categories you can think of. We give the user the option to select which category they want to see the top news for. When they select that category they
are prompted with the top 3 stories of that category. By selecting a number from 1 to 3 the are taken one level deeper where they get a small blurb of the story with the author name as well. But that's note it...

At the bottom of each story summary lies a question. What other categoriess are you interested in? When the user types the category, they continue to explore news over and over again until they ultimately decided to exit from the app entirely.

The first step to creating the app was creating a bulder. In my case i used the pokemon gem them began manipuating all aspects of the files.

In this project file we have a Bin Folder, Lib Folder, Gemfile, README, CLI file, environment, Run file etc.

Git init connects the project with git hub that project can be sync with commits thru the process of creation.

the 5 more important file are the enviroment file, the CLI, the story file and the run file.

in the CLI file exists all the interactive code. in the story file is the object, instance and class methods. The environment files house the require and relative require links that pull things together.

At this moment in time the project meets the checklist requirements nevertheless i still see room for improvements here and there and will continue to fine tune it to the perfect sculture like object.
