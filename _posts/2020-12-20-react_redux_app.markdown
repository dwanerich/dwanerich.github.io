For my final project, I built an app that allows users to:

- Log in with a username
- Search for their favorite Albums
- and favorite them so that others can see them on a public board

The front-end is powered by React and Redux, while the back-end API is powered by Ruby on Rails.

The database schema right now consists of one model, Album, which persists when users click on album art generated from a search.
