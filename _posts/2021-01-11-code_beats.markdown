I realized that learning to code for most of us was not actually our first time learning to code. There are many parallels to coding and making beats. Like whatever it is you did before you discovered the wonderful world of software development the sooner you find your parallels i think it helps sometimes conceptualizing things.

Let's say via garageband, logic pro or any other DAW(Digital Audio Workstation). For starters, as a coder and a beat maker we all begin at ideation phase for the most part where we see something in our head that we want to bring to life, we see sounds. Like a musician a coder can have a vision but it is understanding how to leverage the tools to bring that vision to life that's just as essential.

As in beats, in code we start with a project file empty or we can use a session template to get us started, in Logic pro as in Ruby on Rails  we would do `rails g scaffold` or `npx create-react-app my-app`

In DAWs our complete session consists of multi-tracks, similar to components that all work together in a cohesive manner to produce that incredible body of work that you can show off to your friends on all the digital platforms after it's mixed and mastered and distributed by Cd Baby, TuneCore or United Masters lol.

Gem files in Ruby are similar to VST plugins in which a producer or coder can gain instant assess to some magical features that take your music from zero to 100 thanks to the hard work of others.

A musical note is like a line of code, a loop is almost similar to a function or method. a track can be compared to a component. At the end of the day somehow some way, making beats prepared me for coding because ultimately it all boils down to a bunch of small components coming together to make one body of work. The goal as a coder and beat maker is to pull it all together for everyone to be able to enjoy and make the world a better place.
