#### You may notice I haven't posted in for some time now. Upon graduating from Flatiron School I've been ramping up on my data structures and alogrithms so look out for more posts on the subject soon. Building apps just hasn't cut it. Being mindful of the choices we make as we build(DSA's), scalability, good design practice are all equally important skills an excellent candidate for the role has developed.

#### I look forward to sharing in future posts any information that i think may help software engineers on their journey to landing that first role and the lessons I've learned along the way.

### Happy Coding!
