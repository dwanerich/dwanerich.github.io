#### You may notice I haven't posted in for some time now. Upon graduating from Flatiron School I've been ramping up on my data structures and alogrithms so look out for more posts on the subject soon. Any information that i think may help software engineers on their journey to landing that first role and the lessons I've learned along the way i will most certainly post about that too.

### Happy Coding!
