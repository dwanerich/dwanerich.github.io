### Purpose led me to the decision of pursuing a career in software engineering.
### As a young man, i have always been fascinated by the computer and the evolution of techology.
### Unfortunately the opportunity did not open for me to pursue this career.

### After entering as a coder into the health information industry, I’ve been more exposed to a variety of engineering realizing that this is indeed the path for me.

### I will emulate the best that is offered which will put me in good stead in the years that lie ahead.

### Programming is where my love lies therefore I have now made an informed decision to pursue it to the fullest.

### I’m serving as an example to the young people of today to know that they too can grow up and be expansive in any career of their choice that will leave a strong footprint.

### I will continue in the the field of software engineering to give my best knowledge and to open up myself for further knowledge within this sphere. I will do everything in my power to remain open for improvement and suggestion to make this field a wide, aspiring and enticing for which people will want to enter.
