### I decided to pursue a career in software engineering for a purpose.
### As a young man, i have always been fascinated by the computer and the evolution of techology.
### Unfortunately the opportunity did not open for me to pursue this career.

### After entering as a coder into the health information industry, I’ve been more exposed to a variety of engineering realizing that this is indeed the my path for me.

### I will emulate the best that is offered and that which will put me in good stead in the years that lie ahead.

### I have now made an informed decision that programming is where my love lies and therefore i will pursue it to the fullest.

### I’m serving as an example to the young people of today to know that they too can grow up and be expansive in any career of their choice that which will have a strong footprint for them in the future.

### I will continue in the the field of software engineering to give my best knowledge and to open up myself for further knowledge within this sphere and to do everything in my power to remain open for improvement and suggestion and to make this field a wide, aspiring and enticing for which people will want to enter.
