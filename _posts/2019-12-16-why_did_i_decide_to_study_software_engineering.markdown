### If I had to retrace my aha moment it would be the day I visited Google. I was exposed to a world that i could have never fathomed existed. How would I? As a culture we have infused our talents in the music, sports & entertainment industries but have failed to penetrate the tech world.  People of colors made up less than 2% of the empolyees. This is an astounding reality! Even women contributed to 20%.

### After learning more about coding, I discovered that although this career path may impose challenges I wanted in! I could identify that it would be lucrative and substantially impactful, especially to the communities I serve and that in itself would be gratifying. I find that there aren't many things in life that you'll be excited to commit to but in pursuit of becoming a software engineer,  I'm certain that I can in tech and comfortably pay it forward. 


### In a world that suddenly proclaims diversity & inclusion, this translates disproportionately and I'm dedicated to change that. I am the example for the youth to know that we can grow up and be expansive in any environment & career especially one that will have a strong footprint in the future. 

### I consider myself to be gregarious and thrive in social settings but what motivates me in foreign concepts is the need to see my mission through so that I can serve as a testament. I code so that 10 kids that were unfamiliar with it can learn and surpass me. I code so that we can eradicate the 2% reserved for us.
